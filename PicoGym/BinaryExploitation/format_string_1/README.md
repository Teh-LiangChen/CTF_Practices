# Writeup : format string 1

## Overview
This challenge involved a simple format string vulnerability.

## Solution Steps

1. **Understanding the Vulnerability:**
   - Initially, I was unfamiliar with the format string vulnerability.
   - I read the provided link in the hint: [Format Strings](https://lettieri.iet.unipi.it/hacking/format-strings.pdf).

2. **Exploiting the Vulnerability:**
   - From the document, I learned that I could input `%lx` to view the stack content.
   - The first 5 `%lx` outputs are the registers, so I ignored those.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - According to the provided code, the first 64 bytes of the stack contained the content of `secret-menu-1.txt`.
   - The next 64 bytes contained the flag.

4. **Connecting to the Server:**
   - I used `netcat` to connect to the server: `nc mimas.picoctf.net 52303`.

5. **Retrieving the Flag:**
   - Each `%lx` outputs 8 bytes.
   - I needed to skip the first 13 `%lx` (registers and `secretmenu.txt`) and focus on the next values.
   - I input `21 %lx` to retrieve the stack content (the below content has skipped the first 13 `%lx`):
     ```plaintext
     7b4654436f636970,355f31346d316e34,3478345f33317937,30355f673431665f,7d343663363933,7,7e06300ff8d8,2300000007
     ```
   - These values represented the flag in hexadecimal format.

6. **Converting Hex to ASCII:**
   - I converted the hex values to ASCII and got:
     ```plaintext
     {FTCocip5_14m1n44x4_31y705_g41f_}46c693
     ```

7. **Reversing the Endianness:**
   - The values were in little-endian format, so I reversed them 8 characters by 8 characters:
     ```plaintext
     picoCTF{4n1m41_57y13_4x4_f14g_50396c64}
     ```

## Flag
`picoCTF{4n1m41_57y13_4x4_f14g_50396c64}`
