# Writeup : Picker IV

## Overview
This is a very simple challenge that requires us to make use of a function pointer to point to the correct address

## Analysis

From the provided code, there is a function pointer:

```c
void (*foo)(void) = (void(*)())vall;
foo();
```
This function pointer calls the address according to our input, `val`. Essentially, we need to find out the address of the function that outputs the flag, which is the `win` function.

## Steps to Solve

1. Identify the Target Function:
We need to determine the address of the `win` function. This can be simply achieved by using `objdump` to disassemble the binary and locate the `win` function.

```bash
objdump -d picker-IV | grep win
```
The output will show something like:
```bash
000000000040129e <win>:
```
The address of the `win` functions is `0x40129e`.

2. Exploit the Function Pointer:
Run the provided code and input the address `40129e` when prompted:

```bash
Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding \`0x\`: 40129e
```
This will set the function pointer `foo` to point to the `win` function and call it, thereby triggering the function that outputs the flag.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the function pointer and providing the correct address of the `win` function, we can successfully call the `win` function and obtain the flag.
